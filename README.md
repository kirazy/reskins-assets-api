# Artisanal Reskins: Assets API

This is the main entry-point to the Artisanal Reskin asset mods. Provides convenience methods for
creating Factorio data structures to support reskinning items, technologies, and entities.

## What is this?

This is a collection of images used by Artisanal Reskins and made available to mod authors as a
standalone mod. These asset mods provide icons and sprites with tint masks enabling mod authors to
add items, technologies, and entities with arbitrary colors. They are separate from Artisanal
Reskins, so that mod authors may use these assets in their mods more conveniently.

## Usage Guidance

It is intended that mod authors utilize Artisanal Reskins: Assets API to work with the icons and
sprite sets contained in the Artisanal Reskin asset mods, rather than working with the files and
methods directly.

To use this mod, add it as a dependency. For any assets you want to use, ensure that your mod also
defines the corresponding asset mod as a dependency.
